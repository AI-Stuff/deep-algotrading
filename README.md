#A tour through tensorflow with financial data

I present several models ranging in complexity from simple regression to LSTM and policy networks. The series can be used as an educational resource for tensorflow or deep learning, a reference aid, or a source of ideas on how to apply deep learning techniques to problems that are outside of the usual deep learning fields (vision, natural language).

Not all of the examples will work. Some of them are far to simple to even be considered viable trading strategies and are only presented for educational purposes. Others, in the notebook form I present, have not been trained for the proper amount of time. Perhaps with a bit of rented GPU time they will be more promising and I leave that as an excercise for the reader (who wants to make a lot of money). Hopefully this project inspires some to try using deep learning techniques for some more interesting problems. [Contact me](<ljrconnell@gmail.com>) if interested in learning more or if you have suggestions for additions or improvements. 

Stay tuned for some articles that I will write about the algorithms used here and a discussion of the difficulties of using these techniques for algorithmic trading developement.
